# Project Todos

Building a todo app where I should be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.



## The problem

I approached the problem first  with the store, reduces and the building components and last the style, and the tools and techniques I used to solve it was with building the components and added some react-bootstrap for styling. If I had more time, the next would be the design of the project, though I feel is the most time consuming because of lack of experience in UX.
